# Self-Hosted Portfolio Manager

A self-hosted, lightweight investment portfolio manager built with a Python (FastAPI + SQLite) backend and a modern HTML5 + Vanilla CSS + JS frontend.

### 🎯 Project Origins & Intention
This tracker originally started as a simple tool to monitor cash flows and dividend distributions, focusing on custom asset groupings for **thematic plays** or for consolidated tracking of **stocks with multiple tickers** (e.g. mapping single-stock ETFs alongside their actual underlying equities and/or ADRs in a single view).

Over time, the project evolved into a full-featured dashboard. The codebase heavily favors **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)** integration because it is my primary brokerage account and supports easy API connectivity using the `ib_async` library. The system also supports manual entries and CSV sheets for other brokers like **Moomoo**, though full API automation is not implemented for them due to limitations with their official SDKs.

## 🔒 Environment & Security Context

This project is architected strictly for a **private, single-user local network environment**. It is **not** designed or audited to be exposed to the public internet or hosted in a multi-tenant environment. 

To maintain lightweight development and simple administrative operations, certain functionalities are intentionally permissive:
* **Dynamic Database Patching**: The patching module dynamically imports and executes Python scripts directly from the `patching/` directory based on local JSON manifest instructions.
* **Database Hot-Restores**: The system allows SQLite hot-backups, downloads, deletes, and restorations on-the-fly without built-in credentials.

No authentication, CSRF validation, or multi-user access controls are implemented. If you expose this application to a public network, you do so at your own risk. It is highly recommended to run this container locally or strictly behind a secure private VPN (e.g. Tailscale, WireGuard).

> [!WARNING]
> **Financial & Valuation Disclaimer**: This repository is provided **AS-IS** without any warranties of any kind. The author(s) and contributor(s) are not responsible or liable for any financial loss, transaction accounting discrepancies, incorrect portfolio valuations, trading errors, or damages resulting from bugs or errors in this project. Use at your own risk.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Environment Variables

The application can be configured using environment variables (e.g., in `docker-compose.yml`) or via settings inside `config/config.json` (defaults) or `data/config.json` (user overrides).

### Configuration Overrides Priority
To support dynamic configurations and user-specific customizations:
1. **Database settings table overrides**: Custom configurations stored in the SQLite database (e.g., `sorting.classification_priority`, `external_services.options_tracker_url`, `external_services.backtester_url`) take the highest priority. These can be easily updated via the **Settings** editor tab in the Admin Dashboard.
2. **`data/config.json`** overrides (falls back to `config/config.json` default templates).

If you want to customize your setup, simply place/upload your custom files into `data/`. For full details on all runtime and static configuration keys, see the [Settings & Configuration Guide](docs/settings_configuration.md) and [JSON Data Files Reference](docs/data_files.md).

### Environment Variables
* `BASE_PATH`: Set this (e.g. `/portfolio`) to host the application under a custom prefix path. All internal endpoints, client-side fetch commands, header links, and script references will adapt dynamically.
* `PORTFOLIO_DB_FILE`: File path for the SQLite database.
* `IB_DATA_FILE`: Custom file path for the IBKR position report (defaults to `data/ib_data.json`).
* `exchange_rates_file`: File path for exchange rate caches.

### Dynamic Upload Configuration (`config/config.json`)
The types of files allowed for upload are stored dynamically in [config/config.json](config/config.json). You can add or modify allowed targets on the fly without restarting or rebuilding the container. Note that file uploads for configurations are written directly to `data/` so they remain untracked:

```json
  "allowed_documents": {
    "stock-options": "data/stock-options.json",
    "ib-data": "data/ib_data.json"
  }
```

---

## 🔌 External Services Integration

The application integrates with external services configured under the `"external_services"` key in `config/config.json` (or `data/config.json` overrides):

```json
  "external_services": {
    "options_tracker_url": "http://yui.home/options-tracker",
    "backtester_url": "http://yui.home/backtester/",
    "transaction_ocr_url": "http://yui.home/transaction-ocr/"
  }
```

### 1. Options Tracker Service (`options_tracker_url`)
* **Repository**: https://github.com/SkyStrike/options-tracker
* **Purpose**: Fetches active options contracts, strategy legs, assignment risk, premium metrics, and delivery executions (assignments and exercises).
* **Configured Behavior**:
  * The dashboard builder requests live options positions from this endpoint (`/api/positions`).
  * Displays the **Active Open Options** table.
  * Calculates and renders the **Risk & Liquidity Analysis** sections (Options Exposure & Risk, Cash Stress Test, Portfolio Stress Test, Expiration Profile).
  * Appends option P/L data to the main card header (**"Daily Performance & Options Unrealized"**).
  * **Option Deliveries**: Provides the data source for the Trades Ledger **Option Deliveries** review modal (`/api/deliveries`), allowing 1-click import of option assignments (BUY) and exercises (SELL) booked at **Effective Basis** (`strike - option_premium`).
  * **Fallback**: If the endpoint is offline or times out, the backend falls back to the local `data/stock-options.json` file cache (if available).
* **Unconfigured/Empty Behavior**:
  * Setting this URL to `""` or omitting it completely disables options tracking.
  * All options tables, exposure/risk metrics cards, and stress tests are completely hidden from the user interface.
  * The header card fallback behaves cleanly, displaying only **"Daily Performance"**.

### 2. Backtesting Service (`backtester_url`)
* **Repository**: https://github.com/SkyStrike/backtester
* **Purpose**: Links underlying assets from the dashboard to a historical backtesting engine.
* **Configured Behavior**:
  * Renders a direct backtest link (🔗) next to the header of each underlying asset group.
  * Clicking the link redirects to the backtest service with tickers and date boundaries pre-populated in the query parameters:
    `http://yui.home/backtester/?tickers=QQCL.TO,HYLD-U.TO&startDate=2025-01-01&endDate=2026-06-20`
  * The tickers are automatically converted to their respective `yfinance` formats.
  * The `startDate` defaults to the earliest transaction date recorded for the underlying group.
* **Unconfigured/Empty Behavior**:
  * Setting this URL to `""` or omitting it disables the backtester links. No link icons are shown next to the underlying assets.

### 3. Transaction OCR Service (`transaction_ocr_url`)
* **Purpose**: External OCR service for processing trade confirmations and statements.
* **Configured Behavior**:
  * Displays a direct link to the transaction OCR service under the **Services** top navigation dropdown menu across all pages.
* **Unconfigured/Empty Behavior**:
  * Setting this URL to `""` or omitting it removes the link from the **Services** dropdown (and hides the Services menu if no other services are configured).

## 🖩 Interactive Utilities

### 1. Position Calculator Widget
The application includes a comparative multi-ticker **Position Calculator** that floats at the bottom-right of the dashboard:
* **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Open multiple ticker columns at once to simulate price and transaction size variations.
* **Capital Flow Direction**: Color-coded and signed transacted amounts (outflows/buys are negative red, inflows/sells are positive green).
* **Denominator Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts the total portfolio market value denominator by the sum of all transacted values for true projected weightage.
* **Within-Stock Trimming %**: Computes and displays the change percentage within the individual asset to visualize trim ratios (e.g. `-25%` trim).
* **Enforced Lot Guidances**: Enforces a minimum lot size of `100` for Singapore/Canadian listings, and `1` for standard US stocks.
* **Max Populate Shortkey**: Click the `Max: -[qty]` link next to the lot guide to instantly populate the simulated shares input field for full liquidations.

## 🗃️ Supplementary Data Files

The system relies on supplemental data files (typically placed in the `/data` or `/config` directory) to enrich calculations and coordinate settings.

| File Path | Description / Purpose | Usage & Behavior | If Missing / Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`data/config.json`** | Application parameters (conversion rates, color schemes, allowed uploads). | Loaded on startup and UI render. Primary config. | Falls back to **`config/config.json`**. |
| **`data/ib_data.json`** | Broker position report containing actual holdings size, cost basis, and balances (NetLiquidation, GrossPositionValue, TotalCashValue) for IBKR. | Used for stock reconciliation (`IB Sync` badge / `IB Mismatch` warning) and cash reporting. | Reconciliation checks are skipped; cash reports default to database-only. |
